          Some time ago I noticed there was money to be made on Medium. I joined
          the Medium Partner Program and moved some of my posts behind the
          metered paywall. Time to become a millionaire.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I quickly wrote a new blogpost and shared it on Reddit. This received
          some backlash as someone commented "Too bad you care about money more
          than sharing it. ¯\(ツ)/¯". That hurt, but it was also kinda true.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This sparked a thought in my head. I can just create my own blog.
          Maybe add some ads. And still become a millionaire. I can just blog
          about building a blog. Easy does it.
