          Some time ago I noticed there was money to be made on{" "}
          <TextExternalLink to="https://medium.com/">Medium</TextExternalLink>.
          I joined the{" "}
          <TextExternalLink to="https://medium.com/creators">
            Medium Partner Program
          </TextExternalLink>{" "}
          and moved some of my posts behind the{" "}

          <TextExternalLink to="https://www.reddit.com/">
            Reddit
          </TextExternalLink>
          . This received some backlash as someone commented "Too bad you care
          about money more than sharing it. ¯\(ツ)/¯". That hurt, but it was
          also kinda true.

          This sparked a thought in my head. I can just create my own blog.
          Maybe add some ads. And still become a millionaire. I can just blog
          about building a blog. Easy does it.
